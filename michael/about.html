    <p>France should always be a country of migration. Their history has inevitability put them in infinite debt with their ex-colonies, 12 of which still pay a <span class="highlight">‘colonial tax’,</span> a system denounced by the European Union, however, France is not yet ready to part from the 500 billion dollars brought in every year by Francophone countries.</p>
     
    <p>Last year France’s right-wing party was elected into power, with this, Marine Le Pen brought in <span class="highlight">a new law</span> that restricts the flow of migrants. <span class="law">It makes visas harder to obtain, increases the detention before expulsion period (from 12 to 32 days), it brings in the <em>Contrat d'Accueil et d'Intégration</em> which lets the boarder control integrate all migrants who want to settle into France, and it takes away the right of anyone who has lived in France for 10 years the chance to gain residency.</span></p>
     
    <p>With a pop-up studio in France’s largest migrant community, <span class="highlight">Château Rouge, Paris,</span> we photographed passers by. The white background removes the sitter from the context of France, something the new law has enforced onto the people, quite literally removing them from the country and along with all their rights.</p>
