			<h1 class="center">THE PROJECT STORY</h1>
			<p>I first discovered NYU's ITP graduate program in early 2012, and in June of that year I went to their ITP Camp, once dubbed "summer camp for grown up creative geeks" by Gizmodo. I had such a great time and learned so much that I couldn't stay away in June 2013.</p>

			<p>As a "sophomore", I had some specific goals this time around. One was to produce a concrete, tangible final project. It had to be simple enough to complete a prototype in time for the end-of-camp show, but still interesting enough that I wouldn't be embarrassed to sit it next to everyone else's <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/category/campers-blog" target="_blank">amazing work.</a></p>

			<p>I spent the first few weeks learning about everything from projection mapping to Arduino sensors to Python to Max/MSP to aerial mapping. Riding the train home each night, I scribbled tons of half-baked ideas into my notebook. But most of them were much too complicated to complete in my short timeline.</p>

			<p>Another thing that happens every June is Father's Day. My dad commutes from Atlanta to New York City for work each week, and in NYC he lives in a very sparsely-furnished apartment. For Father's Day, I wanted to give him some fake flowers and a vase to add some color and "life" to his living space. I spent the Sunday before running around the village looking for silk flowers. That same Sunday, I went to a camp session on Soft Circuits led by <a href="http://jenliujenliu.com " target="_blank">Jen Liu.</a></p>

			<p>In that session, all my ideas converged into the simplest one yet, LED flowers that light up only when placed inside a special conductive vase. With Jen's and other campers' help, I sketched a very simple circuit to make this possible. I also learned from Jen that you can bake LED lights into Sculpey clay to create illuminating sculptures. My video partner-in-crime <a href="http://www.maiastern.com" target="_blank">Maia Stern</a> has a second talent as a sculpey-tor, so I asked her to design the  flowers out of the clay. I used the laser cutter to cut stems and battery holders out of scrap pieces of acrylic, and I lined a  glass vase with aluminum foil. </p>

			<p>On the day of the show I took a personal day from work so I could assemble all the pieces. My goal was to create three functional flowers. Of course, assembly took much longer than intended, and it was a challenge to keep the circuit attached and connected. In the end, I learned how to solder so I could just glue everything together. I finished the third flower just in time for the final bell ring, and I was very happy to have three functional prototypes in time for the show. </p>
